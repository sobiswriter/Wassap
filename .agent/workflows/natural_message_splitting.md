description: Implementing natural, human-like message splitting for AI personas.
---

1.  **Analyze current message handling**: Identify the code in `App.tsx` that processes AI responses.
2.  **Implementation Plan**: Create a plan for splitting AI responses into chunks and sending them with delays.
3.  **Update Types/Constants**: Define any new constants for split logic if needed.
4.  **Refactor handleSingleResponse**: Implement chunked message delivery for single chats.
5.  **Refactor handleGroupResponse**: Implement chunked message delivery for group chats.
6.  **Verify**: Test with long responses to ensure they appear sequentially with realistic delays.
